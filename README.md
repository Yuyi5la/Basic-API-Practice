# Basic API Practice

This project demonstrates a simple API built with Node.js and Express, accompanied by a basic HTML frontend. It's designed as a beginner-friendly exercise to understand the fundamentals of API development and interaction.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.js`: Main server file that sets up the Express application and defines API routes.
- `frontend.html`: A basic HTML file to interact with the API endpoints.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuyi5la/Basic-API-Practice.git
   cd Basic-API-Practice



2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

   The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Access the frontend:**

   Open `frontend.html` in your web browser to interact with the API.

## 🧪 API Endpoints

* `GET /api/data`: Retrieves sample data.
* `POST /api/data`: Sends data to the server.
* `PUT /api/data/:id`: Updates existing data based on ID.
* `DELETE /api/data/:id`: Deletes data based on ID.

*Note: Replace `/api/data` with the actual routes defined in your `index.js` if they differ.*
